# Rock paper scissors

This is a simple Rock paper scissors game between a player and the computer.

Better solutions are most likely out there, but this was the first time I used the pygame module.

## Prerequisite

This game has been written with Python3

This program requires the _pygame_ module.

If you don't have it installed, it can be installed by typing.

$ pip install pygame
```

## How to run

Download/Clone the repo and enter the *root* folder.

Type the command below in the Terminal/Powershell window.

```
$ python3 src/main.py
```

## GUI

The GUI is simple and straightforward.

When you start the program, you are greeted with a "home screen"
