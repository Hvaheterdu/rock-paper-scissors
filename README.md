# Rock paper scissors

A simple Rock paper scissors game between you and the computer.

Better solutions are most likely out there, but this was my first use of the pygame module.

## Prerequisite

The ***pygame*** package needs to be installed.

If you don't have it installed, it can be installed by typing

```
$ pip install pygame
```

or

```
$ pip3 install pygame
```

The first one is usually used on Windows when you only have one Python version installed.

The second one is usually used on macOS, because the system uses Python@2.7 and typing *pip* instead of *pip3* will install the package with Python@2.7

*pip3* makes sure the module is installed on the Python3 version that you have installed.

## How to run

Download/Clone the repo and enter the *src* folder.

If you are using a mac, type the command below in the Terminal.

```
$ python3 main.py
```

If you are using a windows machine, type the command below in Powershell

```
$ python main.py
```
By typing this command, the game will start.

## GUI

As said, this is a straightforward GUI.

When you start the program, you are greeted with a "home screen" that looks like

This is an example of how the game looks when you play it.
